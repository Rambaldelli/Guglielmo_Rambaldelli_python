METHILATION 
It is calculated as a mean of the methilation status of a pool of cell. (N.B. two alleles) 

ISLAND: 
	-CG > 50%
	-200 bp
	-observed / expected > 0.6
SHORE:
	-0-2 kbp around
SHELVES
	-2-4 kbp around

CHIPS---------------------------------------
12 sample
14 beads for each sequence

BISULFITE
metC -> C -> C 
C -> U -> T

HYBRIDIZE
	-INFINIUM 1: high frequency region	
		-2 probes 
		-one color
	-INFINIUM 2: low frequency region
		-one probe
		-two colors

SINGLE BASE EXTENSION
	-C,G: green
	-A,T: red

450K ILLUMINA CHIP
	-486428 probes
	-65 SNP
	-850 control probe

PIPELINE------------------------------------
1. Import raw data files
2. Quality checks and probe filtering
3. Background correction and normalization
4. Batch effects
5. Differential methylation
6. Biological interpretation

CORRECTION AND NORMALIZATION-----------------------------------
-background
	-use the control probes
	-NOOB: use the wrong color in type 1 probes (OOB) as background (BETTER)

-peak (between type 1 and 2 probes) (less tecnical variation)
	-not so safe on real data

-quantile
	-replace value with mean of all sample in the same rank
	-N.B.: assume that the beta value between sample are similar between sample and that the error are due to tecnical problem

	-can also be used to normalize type 1 and 2 probes

-subset quantile normalization(avoid to normalize to different distribution)
	-SWAN: based on GpC content of subset
	-SQN: based on the region where the subset map

-functional normalization
	-applied on the out of band(wrong color inf1) probes

M VS BETA VALUES--------------------------------------
-BETA(percentage of methilation in each position): heteroschedastic
-M(log version of beta): homoschedastic (better for small[4-5 sample] set)

ANALYSIS-------------------------------------------------------
PARAMETRIC VS NON PARAMETRIC TEST
	-SMALL DATASET
		-non par. = 
		-par. = 
	-LARGE TEST
		-same results

DMP and DMR
Differentialy meth probes and differentialy meth REGION(a lot more relevant).
ES. GSEA: look if sampe share concordance in the meth regions.


MULTIPLE TEST CORRECTION-----------------------------------------
FWER(es. bonferroni)
	-probability of one false positive in m test: 1-(1-a)^m  -> divide treshold by the number of test
FDR(es. benjamin-hocberg)
	-consider the rank  ->  a^(k\m)
