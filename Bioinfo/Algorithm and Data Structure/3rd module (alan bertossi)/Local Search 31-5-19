LOCAL SEARCH 
You know a solution, you look for a better solution in the neighborhood.

N.B: find a local optimum but if we prove that the local is also the global it is ok.

EXEMPLE: LOCAL SEARCH FOR MINIMUM SPANNING TREE [REALLY SLOW]-------------------------------------------
NEIGHBORHOOD: add an edge and delete a different edge from the crated circle.


EXEMPLE: SORTING--------------------------------------------------------------------
-consider all permutation
-for each of them the neighborhood are all the equals permutation with just one element moved
-find the one with least inversion in the order
