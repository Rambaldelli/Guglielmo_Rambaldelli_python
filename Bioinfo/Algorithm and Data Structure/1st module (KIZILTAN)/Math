SERIES(sum over K)
-Areithmetic
-sum of squares
-sum of cubes
-geometric
-logK
-K^p

SETS
-subset
-operation
-law
	distributive
	de morgan 
	ecc.
-power set: the set that contain all the possible subset of the original set.
-cartesian product (AxB)

RELATIONS (is a subset of the cartisian product between two set)
[B.N.: fuction is a specific case of relation]
-proprieties
	-reflexive
	-symmetric
	-transitive
	-antisymmetric
-order
	-partial
	-total

FUNCTIONS
f:A->B : function from domain A to codomain B.
N.B.: for every A just one B

-Range: subset of the codomain where the values fall.
-proprieties:
	-injection: different A give different B
	-surjection: range = codomain
	-bijection: both of above => PERMUTATION (bijection of a set in itselfs)
-inverse: f -> f^-1 (need to be an injection)
