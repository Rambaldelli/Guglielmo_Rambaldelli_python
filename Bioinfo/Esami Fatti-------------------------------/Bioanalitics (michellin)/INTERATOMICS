INTERACTION STUDY METHOD
-co-immunoprecipitation
-GST pull down
-protein arrays
-yeast two hybrid system
-phage display 

PHAGE DISPLAY:
-put the library we want to studi in a bacteriophage(phage of e. coli) population so they experess on the membrane.
-select the right one using a receptor of our target bound to a surface.
-amplify in bacteria the selected one and repeat from start.
=> we obtein protein with really high affinity after some cycle



RET(non radiative enery transfer[proximity essay  under 10 nm.]):
-FRET:between two fluorescent moleculs
	fotobleaching:bamage the target so  only one read
-BRET:donor bioluminescent and reciver fluorescent(we use the ratio between the two weawelenght as a signal so we normalize the data)
	can use QUANTUM DOT(semiconducting crystal)
N.B: 
-can exite the tester without exciting the sample, we can do time resolved frluorecence to remove autofluorescence in the sample.
-can be used intramolecularly to monitor activity.

INTEIN:
sequence capable of self-clivage and than reunite the two part itself.
-remove tag from protein after purification(we can make the clivage controlled).

PROTEIN COMPLEMENTATION ESSAY:
bound two part of the reporter protein two the two sample protein and if they unite we have signal.
N.B: easy false positive: the two part of the reporter have high affinity
