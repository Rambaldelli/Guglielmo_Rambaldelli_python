>Data(genomics,transcriptomics,regulomics, proteomics, interactomics,metabolomics,physiomics)->
--Genomics:just chemical info of a single cell
--Transciptomics:RNA(pre-protein) info of a population
--regulomics:moleculs responible for trascription
--proteomics:protein interaction
--metabolomics:metabolites and enzimatic chemistry
--lipidomics:lipid chemistry
=>FILTERING DATA(GOOD DATA SAVED)
=>DATA ANALYSIS(REDUCE DATA TO MODEL)
>Fitting procedures(see if a model is good enough to understand what are you trying to understand)
--interpolation
--regression
>Compute trought a model
>Test the model with statistics
