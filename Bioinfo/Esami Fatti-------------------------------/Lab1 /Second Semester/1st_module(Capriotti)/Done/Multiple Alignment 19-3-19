-conserved structure : probably functional
-family specific

SEQUENCE PROFILE
matrix that tell us for every position wich are the chance for every amminoacid.

SEQUENCE LOGO
each position has the possible amminoacid letters in different size on in to signal the information entropy in each position.

SCORING
-it is the sum of all the pairs (using normal scoring matrix) present 		in the multiple sequence alignment
-profile is build minimizing the entropy
-each position have a different scoring depending on the profile
	-normal matrix * frequency of the amminoacid in that position
	=> profile score = sum of all of them

PROFILE SCORING
-all sostitution(frequency wise) * standard scaring matrix for that particular substitution

MSA EVALUATION
* : conserved

IMPROVE MSA
-find better tree (es. phylogenetic tree)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGIES
-MSA
-Exact Algorithm

-Progressive aligment
-Iterative algorithm
-Consistency Based Alg


PROGRESSIVE (clustalW)--------------
-all pairwise => similar seq => build similarity tree
-create profile => align profile

--CONS--
-error propagate
-gaps proliferate
-gaps amminoacid specific but need more data\computation time

ITERATIVE (es. muscle (very fast))--------------
-create kmers
-align frequency of kmers (make everything go fast)

-make tree
-kimura distance
-UPGMA
-repeat

N.B.: 
-use log expectation score
-use UPGMA

CONSISTENCY (T-coffe)---------------
Use transitive proprty to maximize the number of consistrncy in an alignment.
Test different tree tofind the one with higher consistency

-align pairwise 
-create library (weight(similarity) between all pairwise)
-create extended library (summarize all alignment with weight)
-use the weight to align future sequence
