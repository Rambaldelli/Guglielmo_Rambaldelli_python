SNP:single nucleotide polimorfism(%)
SNV:single nucleotide variance
-homozigous(all the reads give same result)
-heterozigous(reads give two different result for that nucleotide[maybe duplicate reads problem so at least 3 reads per type])

N.B: we can be only sure of heterozigous reads but we cant be sure of homozaigous because of chance, but higher depth give us higher confidence.

SIFT: gravity of a specific SNP
