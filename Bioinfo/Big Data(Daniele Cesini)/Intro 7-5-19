BIG DATA
	variety 
	velocity
	volume
	veracity: can be trusted?

ANALITICS
	-descriptive
	-predictive
	-presriptive: how to deal with?

FLOPS: floating point operation per second
IOPS: input outpu operation per second

PC OR DATACENTER
-computing
-storage
-networking
-cooling and supply

CPU:
	-computing power: frequency * core * vector registry = GigaFlops

HARD DRIVE(few powerfull cores):
	-HD:  BANDWITH 	 150mb\s 	IOPS: 100-200
	-SSD: BANDWITH	 500mb\s	IOPS: 100k-200k
	-NVM: BANDWITH	 2000-4000	IOPS: 5-17M
	-TAPE:BANDWITH	 250mb\s	IOPS: just one 

GPU(a lot of bad cores):
	-TFLOPS: 0.5-7 

NETWORK:
	-ethernet:	BANDWITH:10mb\s to 1gb\s	LATENCY: 50-150 microsecond
	-infiniband:	BANDWITH:QDR,FDR,EDR:1gb\s	LATENCY: <1ms			=> good for parallel processing
