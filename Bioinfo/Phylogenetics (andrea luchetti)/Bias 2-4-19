BIAS
-FOSSIL PLACING
-we know the minimum age but we dont know if it is in our tree or is just an extint race that divided from the 'steam'.
-we are not sure if they are at the beginning of the  'crown' or in the 'steam'
=> SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS (we risk an analysis based on priors and not on data)

-OVERPARAMETRIZATION
-may give problems reaching che convergence

-NUCLEOTIDE COMPOSITION BIAS
-we can use the changes in the composition to detect change in environment.
-different part of the genome have different nucloetides prevalence zone=> ISOCHORES
	-G\C: coding
	-A\T: other
 	-reason:
		-selective mutation
		-mutation bias
		-compositional variation

-SIGNAL SATURATION
-too much mutation reverting older ones
-to many divergent species that underestimate the real one

-LONG BREANCH ATTRACTION
-long(longer than everything else) breanches tend to bias the topology due to convergent mutation
- !!! maximum parsimony mainly problem !!! => felsenstein zone(tree space part where max parsimony performs worse than max likelyhood)
	N.B: farris zone: opposite: long breanch atraction is right

-FIXATION
-speciation time is a lot shorter than fixation time so it can seems that two different species are in the same breanch when they dont.
	=> incomplete lineage sorting
=> longer coalescence increase chance of getting better tree

-DRASTIC EVOLUTIONARY EVENT
