sequence only mRNA 


SAVE MONEY:
-dna pooling(sequence many individual together putting together equimolar DNA of each individual)
-search only for a few SNP that segregate in all individuals(we need SNP of wich te allele are present in all population but in different %[hardy weinber equilibrium])
-avoid repeted and dont sequence whole genome with gel\leadder run

TOOL: know that you can use  (call rate-hardy-MAF-stratificatio-significan data)
BWA (bam file) N.B: no sequence with big gaps in it
PLINK: set P value(based on allele frequency) for Hardy when is in disequlibrium
