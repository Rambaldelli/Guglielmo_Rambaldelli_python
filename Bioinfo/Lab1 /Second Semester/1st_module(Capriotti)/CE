CE(combinatorial extension) ALGORITHM
-align actameric fragments(local)
-unite fragment
-optimize fragment path
-optimize: dinamic programming
-statistics
=> longest path on SIMILARITY MATRIX

HEURISTICS(rules used to no have to calculate every possible alignment)
-You can add a fragment to the perwious if they align without o with max one gap.
-max gap size 30

SIMILARITY MATRIX
-RMSD
-inter resideue distange in single fragment
-distance between residues of two frag.

STATISTICS
-probability of obtaining better(longer or less gaps) path using a random set of non redundant structure.
-best Z-scoring alignment are check for RMSD
-try to relocate GAPS a bit
-dynamic programming aptimization using obtained superimposition

!LIMITATION!
-lost topology
-8 frag unit = not sure
