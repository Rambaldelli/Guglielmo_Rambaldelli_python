ANNOTATION:Add to a string a series of functional end structural information.
ASSEMBLY: fragment that have been intergratet together via an algorythm

50% of proteine are enzymes

DSSP: program, use PDB file and add secondari chains to the beackbone of the protein 
because we cant see the hydrogen atoms in then cristallization of the protein

RESOLUTION: it is a problem only for x ray cristallography not for NMR 
and it is the precision with  wich we can put electron density on the molecule

PDB: contein the redution of the data taken from the electron density[CONTEINS A REDUCED RAPRESSENTATION OF THE PROTEIN STRUCTURE]

SIGNAL PEPTIDE: N-terminal sequence of a protein that will be cleaved on maturation




CLUSTERING: define rules to compare(allignment) our data in cluster
-SCOP classification: clustering rule based on secondary structure
-PROTEIN FAMILY: protein with the same fold and same funcion (not sequence) in different organism and supermiposible
 
N.B cluster the archive to find there are protein superimposible in terms of structure and can be devided in family and usually protein with the same structure have the same function

ALIGNMENT: superimpose(tagret to template) to protein\sequence and calculate the RMSD. (2-3 A is the max) and we can mesure the IDENTITY number of residues in the same position %
Sequence alignment is validated by structure alignment.

N.B: lower is the identity(al least 30%), we need more aligned residues(at least 200) to say that there is a structure similarity => stucture and function are more conserved than sequence.
DISTANTLY RALATED OMOLOGUE: same protein family but identity below 30%

UTILITY: if we create a FAMILY of protein of wich i know the function(template) then i can say that if i have(target) 30% identity and 250 residues probably they have similar function.
