novaseq = 6 tb run
sequel = 10000 bp read

SECOND GEN SEQ
-precise
-high troughtput

-PCR make errors

THRD GEN SEQ(pac bio\nanopore)
-detect base modification
-sequence RNA
-long reads(more than 1 MB)

-less precisee
----------------------------------------------------
MICROBIOTA COMPOSITION
commensal
mutual
perassite
opportunist patogen

APROACH
barcode
metabarconde
shotgun metagenomics
functional metagenomics

16S BARCODING
9 variable region flanked by fixed one

Always go to LCA(least common ancestor) or use TANGO classification

TOOL
biomas
metashotgun

METASHOT
A lot of reads and assign each of them to a specie and than chose theone with the higer number of association

PROBLEMS
-contaminated database genomes
-taxonomy error
