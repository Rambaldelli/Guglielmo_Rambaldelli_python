GENE TYPE
homologous: share ancestry
	ortologs: divided by speciation
	paralogous: divided by gene duplication => bonus gene for free evolution
analogs: same function no ancestry

WARINING PARALOGOUS GENES
-paralogous gene can be confused as ortologs and we can end up using two genes that are not under the same type of pressure.
	-mitocondrial DNA have no paralogous genes
-TOPOLOGY: given that we have two one can degrade and became a pseudogene that can give problem durin analysis because we can lose different copy in different organism

ES ALLOPATRIC SPECIATION
speciation based esternal cause effect genes but it can happen in different way sand can lead to errors (N.B.: species tree vs ! gene tree !)

COALESCENCE THEORY [POPULATION genetics] (merging of lineages going back in time)
-neutral evolution
-infinitenshites
-panmictic pop.
-costant pop. sixe
-non overapping gen

p(species tree)= (2\3)*e^-t\2N => increase coalescent time decrease probability to find wrong tree



CHARACTERs FOE ANALYSIS
-must be homologous \ ortologous (ortologous genes and/or sites)
-compare ortologous sites for wich we can have different states (every single nucleotide position)
