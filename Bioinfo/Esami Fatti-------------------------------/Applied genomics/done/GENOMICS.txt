SEQUENCING:
MAIN PROBLEM: short read one\twohundred nucleotides N.B. PACBIO produce long read but slower
STORAGE: the data collected are stored in FASTQ format: name-sequance-quality score for evey nucleotide(asci char.)

-SANGER: 
PCR with one primer and COLORED ddNTP then run on gell and based on the lenght of the fragment you can order the different colored ending nucleotides.

-ION TORRENT TECNOLOGY: 
SAMPLE PREPARATION: fragment genome randomly, bind stichy hands an EMULSION(every droplet of oil will be a single well of the reading with the fragment bound to the "sphere") PCR(univ. primers)=> a lot ofcopy of the same fragment.
one primer bound to the dish and a lot of copy of the sequence bound to it, add nucleotides (relesed in order not uniform to see if there are mixed reads in the same well) binding relese H+ that can be sensed and so we can know if that specific nucleotide bound to the chain(or multiple copy of the same one[increase even more the PH change but can give problem on long stertch of the same nucleotide]).
More or less one error every onehundred nucleotides.
COVERAGE: % of genome covered by at least one read.
DEPTH: how many reads of that specific area we have

-ROCHE454:
Can sequence long stretch of genome.
Too much expansive.
SAMPLE PREPARATION: exactly the same of ion torrent but the reads ar done with light produced by enzime from the PPi(PPi=>ATP=>light) relesed by the bond formation.

-ILLUMINA: Most used one(cheap) and no problem with omopolimeric region.
SAMPLE PREPARATION: add primer to the fragment, bound them to a surface with both end bound(bridge) than we keep anealing and PRCing so we crate cluster bound to the surface together.

We can add all nucleotides together and each of them have a different fluor so we can see wich one bound each time.
After one is bound we need to remove the fluor and the block bound to the nucleotide for the rection to procede.
