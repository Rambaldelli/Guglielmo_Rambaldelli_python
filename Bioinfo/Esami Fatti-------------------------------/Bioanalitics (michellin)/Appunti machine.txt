2 way electroforesis

-improvment

2 way cromatograpy

MASS SPECTROMETER:
-ionization
-MALDI: laser on cromophoric matrix, soft, single charged
-ESI: gold charged tip and hot nitrogen,soft, multy charged
-FAB:atom bombardment on matrix, semihard, multy charged

MASS 
-ION TRAP
-QUADIPOLE
-ION TRAP
-TOF: time of flight based on mass

REFLECTOR
refect the ions back so the ions with same m\z ratio will arrive together and improve resolution

N.B. when the electron hit the detector they will generate secondary eletron


MASS RESOLUTION: 
-the nerrower the peaks the better the resolution,
 using the the point at the middle of the peak
-it depends on the calibration of the machine

HYBRID INSTRUMENTS
two mass analyzer in tandem: the first select the parent ions and then they are fragmented and sent to another mass analyzer

QTOF
spray - quadruple - collision cell - TOFÃ¹

FRAGMENTATION:
-PROTEOMICS:fragmentation camber based on a quadrupole
