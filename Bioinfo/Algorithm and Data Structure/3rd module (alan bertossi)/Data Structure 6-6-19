SUFFIX TRIES
-tree
-every edge is a letter
-every sequence end in $
-sequence sharing prefix share the breanch untill they diverge
-a node rappresent a prefix of a sufix

SUFFIX LINKS
connect a X+sting to the same string without X (one character)

CREATE (scan sequence adding every time one mor character at the end of it)
-add to deepest 

-follow link of father 
-add as son
-repeat

PROBLEMS
-longest common substring

SUFFIX TREE--------------------------------------------------------
compress path without choice in a singl edge => use tuple of index for start and end of the substring rappresented.

UKKONEN ALG.: costruct suffix tree in O(n)
	-look for answer O(m) (lenght of the query)

SUFIX ARRAY-----------------------------------------------------------
2 array:
	-sorted prefix
	-index of the sorted prefix (each prefix keep the index it had before sorting)

BUILD:
-build a tree and do an inorder visit saving the index and we have a sufix array.
-Kärkkäinen & Sanders algo O(n).
	-crate array with prefix starting in position not multiple of 3 + sort
	-crate array with prefix starting in position multiple of 3 + radix sort
	-merge with skewed 1\3,2\3 split  

EXIST ALSO IMPROVED VERSION MADE OF 5 AND NOT 2 ARRAY

K-MER COUNTING PROBLEM:
Given a lenght print all the substring of that lenght and how many times it appear.
