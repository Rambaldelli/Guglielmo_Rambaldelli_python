RNA STRUCTURE
-primary
-secondary : parentesis and dots => base pair formalism
-tertiary

N.B. viariable backbone and almost fixed side chain

BACKBONE
-The distance between the various part of the backbone are variable so 		we need to chose what to use based on the distribution of the 		distance.
-We ended up salactiong C3^1 because has a narrow distribution and a 		low variation from a gaussian distribution.
