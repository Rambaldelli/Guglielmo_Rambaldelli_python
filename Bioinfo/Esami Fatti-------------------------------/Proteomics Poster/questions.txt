During presentatin:
- ionisation (step of Mass spectrometry)
- 2d gel electrophoresys (main limitation)
- PPi methods (I started with 2 yeast hybrib and she asked me the limitations of this tenchnic)
- Common steps after 2D-PAGE. Previous steps before performing MS (spot cutting, digestionâ€¦)
- PHAGE display technology
- shotgun proteomics (diff with bottom-up)
- mass fingerprinting
- FRET BRET (energy transfer)
- 
limitations!
