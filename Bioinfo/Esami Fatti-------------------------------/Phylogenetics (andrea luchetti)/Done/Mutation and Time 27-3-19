MUTATION AND TIME
If we assume a constant mutation rate we can use the genetic distance to hypotize the date of the speciation.

Given that the mutation rate is not constant between lineages we need to model it.

MUTATION RATE MODELLING
-strict clock (constant rates)
	-relative rates
	-tajima test
	-
-local clock (every breanch can have different rates inipendantly)
-autocorrelated relaxed clock (closer breanch have similar rates )
	-random on normal distribution of parent
-general relaxed clock (different rates based on a global distribution)
	-random on a distribution

	N.B.:NON PARAMETRIC RATES SMOTHING
	User defined philogeny

CALIBRATING
-fossil
	-give min age
	
	-distribution
		-lognormal
		-exponential
		-normal
		-uniform (usual for root of tree: no idea of age)
-biogeagraphy (splitting of lend)
