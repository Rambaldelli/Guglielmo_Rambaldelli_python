-protein more conseved than  sequence
-if high identity can transfer structure

MAIN GRAPH
% residues in core \ seq ID => exponential => more ID = more residues in common core (60 % almost sure alignment)
RMSD \ seq ID => more ID = lower RMSD (60 % = RMSD lower than 1)
seq ID \ lenght of alignment => evolution did it!

REMOTE HOMOLOGS
-low ID
-Similar structure

TWILIGHT ZONE
20 % id => 90 % of alignment are homologous( below 25% only 10 are homologous)
	30< safe
	20<30 twiglight : be cautious
	20> midnight : false positive

STRUCTURE ALIGNMENT
-corrispondence set (NP-hard)
-alignment transformation (O(n))

treshold 3.5 A because is distance between Calphas

THEORETICAL METHOD
-define unit
-algorithm with minimal distance
-verify significance

JACCARD DISTANCE (used to calculate distance between function: GO terms)
Between two groups is the intersection devided the union.
