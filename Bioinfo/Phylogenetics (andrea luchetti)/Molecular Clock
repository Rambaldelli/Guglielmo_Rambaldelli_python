MOLECULAR CLOCK
There is a mutation\time relationship at a constant mutation rate => we can use mutation rate to date the common ancestor

! WE HAVE TO CONSIDER NATURAL SELECTION !
-we risk to understimate time so we need to use genes that are not under natural selection.
-we risk to make the tree on a phenotipe\genotipe instead that on the evolution
