THERMODINAMICS: science of how trasformation work free energy wise (explain function)

U(internal energy)=Q-W
H(enthalpy)=U+pv
DeltaS(etropiy)=DeltaQ(reversible)\T
G(gibbs)=H-TS

eqK=[prodotti]\[reagenti]
DeltaG=-R*T*ln(Keq)     R=8,314  DelatG=DeltaG+RTln(Keq)



ENERGY COUPLING

DGibbs\Dmol=chemical potential=ammount of work you get changing the concentration of the solution
Y(chemical potential)=Y0+RTlnC(cncentration)
If you have two different solution with C1 and C2 with a semipermeable membarane between them you have:
DY=+RTln(C1\C2)
IT IS THE MAIN OBJRCTIVE OF RESPIRATION AND PHOTOSYNTESIS to recharge ATP
