NETWORK
-sys biology
-network biology

---GRAPH THEORY---
Can be rapresented as adjacency matrix(the degree of a node is with how many nodes interact)
EDGES
-undirected(degree): no direction
-directed(in\out degree): with direction
-weighted(weighted degree)

SHORTEST PATH 
The shortest path between the two most distant entities

SCALE FREE
Few high grade nodes and a lot of low grade

TRANSITIVITY
If we have dense subnetworks that dose not interact to much between them

CENTRALITY
Importance of the node in the network considering two start\end node


---ANALYSIS---
-substructure
-annotation


---STRUCTURE---
-CLIQUE
Group in wich ever node interact with every elese.
-COMUNITY
-MOTIF
