MOLECULAR MARKER
-sequencing: cds/non coding
-mtDNA: god for shallow nodes
	high variability
	no ricombination (recombine but no effect because copy are identical)
	haploid
-nDNA: good for deep nodes
	less variable
	recombination
	n-ploid
-protien
	more conserved
-rare changes
	most conserved and last resort


STUDY
-mtDNA:
	-gene order: rare changes 
-nDNA:
	-transposable elements: avoid partially short covalescence time
