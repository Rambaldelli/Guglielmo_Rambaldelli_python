-square, triangular, identity, invers, vector, symmetric(A=At) matrix

-scalar*matrix
-sum of two matrix
-mtrix*matrix (A(p,n)*B(n,q)) non commutative
-inversion of matrix (a^-1= 1\detA(*main diag switch and secondary sign change) only if deatA non 0)
-determinant (product of main diagonal-productof the secondary)  and for BIGGER THAN 2*2  
-transpose (invert rows with column)  NB if a^-1=At it is ortogonal
-traspose and invers of two matrix invert the order 
-use matrix for system of equation
-matrix as trasformation on vectors
-minor and cofactors
-determinant as area of the trasformation for basic vectors
-NB null space (eigenvalue and eigenvector(are the same number ofthe dimension of the matrix))   det(A-lamda*I)=0=>value (A-lamda*I)v=0=>vectorù
-i=sqr(-1) and complex number
-base change
-diagonalization of matri by base change
-quadratic form
