GREEDY ALG.
One choice at a time, just do the most promising choice every time without backtrakking.
MUST prove optimal substructure and greedy property.


EXEMPLE: MINIMUM SPANNING TREE-------------------------------------------
Connect N elements with some connection restrain using the least ammount of wires.
N.B.: NO CICLES
(es.: ultrametric evolutionary tree, electric cirquit)

RAPPRESENTATION: weighted undirected connected graph
FRAGMENT: sub spanning tree of a tree
SAFE EDGE: minimum edge that leave a fragment creating a bigger fragment

METHOD
-chose a fragment and go for the safe edge
-if to fragment connect they became the same

KRUSKAL ALG [O(m logN)].
-array A of m edges ordered by least weight: each recorded as: u,v,weight
-store fragments as MFset
-store spanning tree as set T
