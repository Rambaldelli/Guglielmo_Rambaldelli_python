HADDOCK: docking server
CLUSPRO: docking server(easy one)

CASP\CAPRI: double blind experiment for prot modelling an PPI

ALANIN SCANNING
Replace residues with alanine(no effect) and see if it modify the interaction.

---DEFINITION---
HUB: A protein that can interact with a lot of protein.
PROTEIN COMPLEX: stable interaction
PPI: protein protein interaction
RECEPTOR(big) and LIGANDS(smal): interaction partner
SHORT LINEAR MOTIF: little conseved motif implied in interaction
DISORDERED PROT: missing secondary structure(cant be cristalize)
DRUG TARGET: prot o nucleic acid whose activity is modified by drug
BIO TARGET: anything also endogen 'drugs'

---INTERACTION---
DIRECT: affect interested prot
INDIRECT: affect another prot that compensate for target

ALLOSTERIC: interact not in the main binding site

BOND TYPE:
WEAK
-reversible
STRONG
-covalent
-really high affinity
-suicide inibitors

PREDICT AFFINITY AND SELECTIVITY
-QSAR

APROACH
-LIGAND BASED: pharmacophore
-RECEPTOR BASED: structure guided

---INTERFACE---
-More idrofobic than rest(pushing force in binding)
	
---ENERGY---
G=H-TS
H=E+VP
E=U(potential)+K(kinetic)

N.B: heat of system is proportional to entalphy

DeltaG<0 for prot-prot interaction => molecule lose entropy and solvent increase it.

---PREDICTION---
-classification
-homology
-hot spot
-docking

DOCKING PROBLEM:
given that two protein interact we canT be sure how, we can just restrict the solution. 

---DOCKING---
-BOUND: dock a known complex to validate the algorithm
-UNBOUND: normal docking(you know they interact but not how)  N.B: prot conformation can change upon binding
-RIGID: prot considered as rigid structure
-FLEXIBLE: consider small part con move(also SEMIFLEXIBLE(just for one molecule))

STEPS
-rapresentation
-conformational space search (find the minimum of the energy)
-ranking solution:geometry and energy => look for big cluster with a lot of low energy solution.
