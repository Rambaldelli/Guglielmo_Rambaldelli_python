# PPI

-It is hard to predict because a lot of **pairwise** interaction are in place.

​	=> pairwise is not enough but we are not able to solve the  **multi body** interaction problem.

-hydrophobic effect 

### KINETIC OF THE FOLDING



## SECONDARY STRUCTURE

DSSP retrieve the secondary structure from the backbone and his hydrogen bonds(1-40 Kcal\mole).

​	N.B.: hydrogen bond need to be plain

### DSSP

Algorithm of pattern recognition.

G = 3-turn helix (310 helix). Min length 3 residues.
H = 4-turn helix (α helix). Minimum length 4 residues.
I = 5-turn helix (π helix). Minimum length 5 residues.
T = hydrogen bonded turn (3, 4 or 5 turn)
E = extended strand in parallel and/or anti-parallel β-sheet conformation. Min length 2 residues.
B = residue in isolated β-bridge (single pair β-sheet hydrogen bond formation)
S = bend (the only non-hydrogen-bond based assignment).
C = coil (residues which are not in any of the above conformations).

HYDROGEN BOND:

​	E < -0.5 Kcal \ mol

​	D < 5.2 A	

### ALPHA HELIX	

More flexible than beta sheet protein.
