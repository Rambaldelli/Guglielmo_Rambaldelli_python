BEANCHMARK (BAliBASE)
SEQUENCE IN DATABASE
-equidistant
-orphan seq
-divergent family
-large N\C extension
-ins\del

SCORE
TC score: consistency of residues in every position
P score:0 or 1: correct or wrong residue
SP score: ratio of P scores

=> PERFORMANCE : radar\spider graph
Standard Z score: use to visualiuze the result normalized

RESULTS 
-consistency method: best but problem with gaps
-muscle and clustal: fast and light
-------------------------------------------------------------------
PARALLELIZATION
-NORMAL: Run every single pairwise alignment on a different GPU
-EMBARASSING PARALLELIZATION: every CPU run a different benchmark process
