N.B: it is enough to have a few SNP and dont take redundant one based on the level of linkage disequilibium(too close to each othe[if it is high we need less SNP]) and take the one with higer MAF.

EFFECTIVE NUMBER: number of parents that contribuited to the creatin of the population.

METHOD:
-created pool of DNA derived from each breed of animal present(4+wt)
-gel run the genome digested with 3 different enzyme with a ladder and we can take the same lenght pieces from all the sample(should me a smear but we can have bands made from repeated reagion that has been cut in tha same way[avoid]).
-created contigues using long reads from roch and than map in the middle with illumina.
-ALLELE SPECIFIC PCR[exist only for main species](work only if there are no repeted sequence nearby): design probes(bound to surface) complementary to the part near(one nucleotide away) the SNP in wich we could add only one nucleotide and se wich one of attach

CLEAN DATA:
-discard DNA with ends that are not the one expected from the enzime.

WINDOWS
consider stretch, in wich i avarage the SNP, of dna when looking for mutation to reduce the bias.
than caluclate a pooled heterozygosity score on the window. 


n.b. pool dna-seq
