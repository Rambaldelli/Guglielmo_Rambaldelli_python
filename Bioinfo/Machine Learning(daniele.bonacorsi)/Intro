T= task
E= experience against itselfs
p= p of victory against other

Aartificial Inteligence > Machine Learning > Deep Learning


Artificail Inteligence(AUTOMATION OF DECISION) VS Human Inteligence
-faster
-larger scale

TYPE of ML
-unsupervised
-supervised
-rinforced

N.B.: always batter to have more parameters that less, we have ways to store an INFINITE number of input


TRAINING SET-----------------------
INPUT: features
OUTPUT: target
PARAMETERS: parameter of the equation describing the regression



SOFTWERE------------------------------
-TENSORFLOW
-KERAS
-PYTHON
