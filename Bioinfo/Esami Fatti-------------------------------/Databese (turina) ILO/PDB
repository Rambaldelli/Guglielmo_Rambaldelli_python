WWPDB(world wide PDB)
-validation entity of all PDB

Even if ther PDB parameters are right it dos not mean that the structure is real but just that it is reallike.
STAT
-RSRZ: residue who do not fit well in the electron density (x-Ray)
-Rfree: how well it predicts

N.B: if a residue is really mobile it decrease it's scattering power

B-factor: based on the mean square displacment of an atom



DYEDRAL ANGLE
N.B: givn that the majority of amminoacids are L sided the right handed alpha-helix are a lot more common.

c-c:phi
n-n:psi
alpa-alpa:omega(almost always 180) N.B: proline can have different one cis=0 trans=180


OCCUPANCY
in pdb look for occupancy because we can have more than one correct position for each atom (occupancy<1)
