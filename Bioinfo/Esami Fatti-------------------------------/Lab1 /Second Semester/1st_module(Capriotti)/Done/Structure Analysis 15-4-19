ANFINSEN HYPOTESIS:
The sequence contain all the info to know the 3D structure
-DOGMA
	-uniqueness: no other structure with compatible free energy.
	-stability: stable to chenges in environment.
	-kinetical accessible: the folding process must have a smooth free energy curve.

DSSP (software)
take a pdb and compute the secondary structure
