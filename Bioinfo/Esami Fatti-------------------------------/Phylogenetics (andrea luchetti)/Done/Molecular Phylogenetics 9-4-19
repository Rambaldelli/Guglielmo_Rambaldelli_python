MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS: MULTIPLE GENE ANALYSIS

PIPELINE
-select some genes
-align orthologues for each OTU
	-use a probe from one species to scan the others
-extract from each OTU
-concatenate

PROBLEMS
-PARALOGS: 'fake orthologs' !!!be wary!!!
-MISSING GENES: some genes can not be present in some lineages
	-up to 25% of missing genes is not a problem
	-partially missing genes: MORE PROBLEMATIC
-COEVOLUTION of genes different from evolution of lineage

APROACH
-Congruence: 
	-have multiple tree that, even if different can be reconciled
-total evidence
