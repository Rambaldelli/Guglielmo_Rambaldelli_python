HMMER (HMM profiling for multiple seq. analysis)
-remote homologs
-HMM
	-start
	-N-ter
	-Domain     -Inter Dom
	-C-ter
	-end
-P(M|s) or P(s|M)

METHOD
-calulate null model probability = P(s|N)
-compare: S(M,s) = log2 (P(s|M) \ P(s|N))      ->       follow extreme value dirtibution
-E value= e^-E * (E^a \ a!)     : Poisson distribution
-P value= 1-e^E value

NOTE
-COMPO: fixed probability used to generate the random sequecy
-3 line for each:
	-first match emission + position and consensus seq
	-second insertion emission
	-transition 

E-value: (LOWER IS BETTER)
	-c: conditional
	-i: independent

USE
hmmbuild <out_file> <multiple_seq_align.sto>                           #.sto is a stokholm file format of multi seq alignment
	-create a profile from a multiple sequence align
hmmemit <HMM_profile>
	-create a random sequence from a profile
hmmsearch <HMM_profile> <Database_file>
	-search sequence that match HMM profile(ordered by E value)
hmmalign <HMM_profile> <seq.fa>
	-make alignment and give probability for each position
hmmpress <hmm_profile>
	-unite models in one indexed file (more than one file)
hmmscan <indexed_hmm> <seq.fa>
	-search in an indexed hmm file(created with hmmpress)


MASKING: can be added to the .sto file in the Header
