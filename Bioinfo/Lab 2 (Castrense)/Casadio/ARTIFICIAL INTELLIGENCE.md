## HMM

The model is global because every position have the same value inside the rules.

# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

So far, a machine is able to elaborate *according to* the way in which it has been organized/built. It is not intelligent on its own.



Use a sliding window method so can catch the local context 



Try to generalize over a pattern.

## MACHINE LEARNING

Try to find a fitting equation to your data. Optimize the parameters that describe the relation between input and output

Extract the correlation between the two sets of data that we expect to be correlated when analytical methods fail,  is a non-analytical fitting procedure b/w dependent and independent variables.

## DEEP LEARNING

We leave the feature extraction to the network and not to us and so speed up the process.
