-vector
-microprocessor
-system on chip

SoCs: low power system on chip
	-smartphone
	-embedded system

Increasing the power = more consumption 
	-1GW = 1 pflop 2015
	-13MW = 200pflop now => 100gflop\wat

CHERACTERISTICS
-low ram
-low consumption

IoT: internet of thing
	-network of devices that is connected to a cloud.


FOG\EDGE COMPUTING
-data processed locally EDGE (no need to send all to cloud)
-data already processed sent to cloud
-can process both locally and in the fog

-EDGE
	-collect data
	-process locally
	-send to cloud

-FOG
	-collect data
	-process in fog(multiple decentralized server)
	-send to cloud
