REFERENCE GENOME

CENTIMORGAN: 1 recombinant every 1000 meiosi

SOMATIC HYBRID CELL:
unite a donor cell with a cancerous cell of another spicies, the resulting cell will lose some of the genome of the donor cell, so we will have a colony of cancerous cell hybridized in random ways.

CREATION:
-Create subset ofthe genome to have a 'bigger part of the picture' to align.
-The subset are create adding one piece to another in succession.


METHOD:
-WHOLE GENOME SHOTGUN:fragment genome than make clone with the random pieces and sequence them.
-HIERARCHICAL SHOTGUN: generate large subset to unify\study later.
We build a map based on linkage disequilibrium on marker studied with 'in situ' hybridization.
Than BAC Clones(clones with plasmid containing large fragment) and fragementation and gell run of the different clones
and looking at clones with fragment of the same lenght we can understand how the different sequence in the clones are orgnaized and create the map of the fragment.
Make somatic hybrid BUT INRADIATE DONOR CELL TO FRAGMENT GENOME so we have the genome divided by cromosome(or at least we know wich hybrid have part of wich cromosome) in the various hybrid, doing PCR with specific primer we can understand in wich cromosome the target of that specific primer is.
N.B: we need a very dense marker map to be able to make it work.
