FOLDING PROBLEM: 
-frustrated system: too meany tendencies in the system
-social entitis

BUILDING(structure from sequence):
-COMPARISON(good one):[30-100%]:
-THREADING:[0-30%]:try some structure and them see wich one fit the sequence
-AB INITIO:[new sequence]:


COMPARATIVE MODELLING(program to use):
-target
-alignment on template (modeller)
-evaluation of model(procheck): if not check alignment and retry
PROTOCOL:
-blast sequence(with REFERENCE DATABASE[structure])
-find PDB reference to write report
-align to reference
-model with modeller

GOAL
-predict prot. 
-predict active prot.
-stable protein
