CLIQUE:graph in which every node isconnected to every other.

Easy to check if a solution is a solution(POLINOMIAL TIME) but hard to find one(EXPONENTIAL).

ES: 
-color node of graph with K different colors in a way that two connected node nevere have the same color.
	-optimization: minimum K
	-decision: how to color the graph
-go trought each node of a graph just one with a max 'distance' travelled of K.
-Given an m×n integer matrix A and a vector b of m integers, is there a vector x of n elements 0/1 such that Ax≤b?
-Given a boolean formula (in conjunctivenormalform), isthere an assignmentof the true/false values to the booleanvariableswhichmake the formula true?
-A polynomial certificate is an algorithm which, given a supposed solution to a decision problem, checks in polynomial time whether such a solution is indeed a solution to the problem giving a YES answer

PROBLEM CLASS:
P: solvable in polinomial time
NP: certificable in polinomial time

NP HARD STRATEGY
-SPECIAL CASE
	-ADD CONDTION
	-ES:
		-satisfiability:each clause max 2 litterals
		-graph color: max two colors
		-clique:bipartite graph
		-linear: just real number
-APROXIMATION	
	-ACCEPT NEAR OPTIMAL SOLUTION
	-the cost of the solution is e(constant) away from the optimal 		-ES: 
		-TPS: traveling sales person problem
			Every hamiltonian path is a spanning tree.
			So the min spanning tree cost <= than TPS path
			If triangle inequality hold => solution at max 				double the cost of optimal

-BRANCH AND BOUND
	-PRUNE SOME WAY
	-BRANCH: rule to generate children of a node
	-BOUND: how to derive the lower bound of the cost
	-after we found a salution each time the cost of other banches goes over it we ignore that path.


-HEURISTICS
	-NO DIMOSTRATION	
	-TYPE:
		-greedy
		-local search
			-remove two and three noncontinue edge and replace them with lower cost 
			-do the process multiple time starting from multiple random starting position
