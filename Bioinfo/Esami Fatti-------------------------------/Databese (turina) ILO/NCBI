NCBI
-genebank:	gene sequence
-gene:		gene specific search
-refseq:	genomic sequence
-dbSNP:		SNP
	-rs-----:	code for cluster of single SNP
-OMIM:		genetic disorder trait(16000 genes)

-gquery(entrez) : 	database wide search system
-blast and psi-blast: 	tool, psi can conserve the profile(multiple run of blast) and so reach more distantly related homologues. 
-HMMER: 		same as blast but based on HMM

N.B: the WGS(whole genome shotgun) sector is increasing very fast.
