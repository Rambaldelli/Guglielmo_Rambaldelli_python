ENANCHER
We can detect what is an enancherbut we have problem understanding what enenche.
-nucleosome depleted
-are transcribed
-near enencher hyston: H3K27ac,H3K4me1
-super enenchers(multiple enenchers)
-autonomously able to initaiate trascription even outside his loci

TECHNIQUE
-cage(trap RNA by the N cap and sequence only the first 20 => we find the origin of trascription)
-atac-seq: cut with trasposase and add primers on the side of the cut(scan the open region: no nucleosome)
 => search for trascription factor mothif.
-chip-seq(es. where a trascription factor binds)
CROMOSOME STRUCTURE	
-C3:crosslink than digest and ligate only the strand in close prossimity and than PCR using the two known sequence as primer.s
-HI-C:same as 3C but than pull-down on the target and sequence.

N.B.
-promoter and enenchers of housekeepig gene are different
-hystone modification= recruitment point

NUCLEOSOME:
PROMOTER: H3K27ac, H3K4me3
WNANCHER: H3K27ac, H3K4me1

-regeneration studies on flies-
injury= increase expression on proliferation related genes.
The activated genes are clustered in the cromosome => GO analisys in single clusters => each cluster is composed of genes from different PATHWAY all referred to the same function, while gene not part of pathway are intersperse.

we get increasing and emerging enanchers in the repairing zone that not necessarly interact with near cluster of genes.
