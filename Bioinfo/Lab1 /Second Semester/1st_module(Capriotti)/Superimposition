STRUCTURE COMPARISON
-structure
-algorithm
-score
COMPONENTS
-input:2 prot.
-output:alignment
-constrain: RMSD, L, GAPS

TOPOLOGY
Direction and position of elements of secondary structure.

PROBLEM
-different domains in the same chain can have multiple conformation, and this get worse when we have multiple chain(ES. same secondary structure but different topology).
-

SUPERIMPOSITION
-Is a rototraslation and so the complexity is O(n)
-minimize RMSD
-maximize number of aligned residues INCLUDING GAPS

METHOD CLASSIFICATION
-TYPE
	-pairwise
	-multiple seq
	-alignment free method -> just give you a score of similarity
-CLASS
	Ca
	AllA
	SSE
	Seq
	C-Map
	Surf
	SASA
	Dihed
	PB
-FLEXIBLE?
	-yes
	-no

COMPARING
-Torsion Angle: good for local BUT bad for whole structure => we lose 	'long range' interaction
-Distance Matrix(all against all matrix):invariant to transformation 	BUT O(n^2) and chirality  insensitive
