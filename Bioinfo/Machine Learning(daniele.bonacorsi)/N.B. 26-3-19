FEATURES SCALING----------------------------------------------------
-Use similar numerical scale for each feature: simplify solution 	space(aim to a nD circle)
-features between +1 , -1
METHODS
-divide by  max value
-mean normalization

PRO
-faster


CREATE FEATURE OR FEATURE ENGENEERING---------------------------------
Modify (even unite some of them)feature to present it to the alg in a different form.   => create a bias to orient the alg into taking a concept into consideration.
