CVN(1kb segment that can or cant be present in a specie's genome[not repeted sequence but (usually)tandem sequence in specific position in the genome])
	-produced by unequal crossingover
	-5-10% of human genome	
	-can cause 'fake' SNP and so fake heterozigosis(seems a SNP but simply we have more copy than the expected from reference genome) 

STUDY METHOD
-SNP GENOTIPING TOOL(SNP chip)
-aCGH(array comparative genome hybridization) [1000 euro already existing 2000-3000 new design]
	-design probe for all the genome avoiding repeted sequence(masked genome) the minimum dimension of the CV that i can detect is 4 times the distance between probes(need atleast 3 probe that detect it to be sure)
	-fix probe to array(need to have similar melting temperature)
	-test REFERENCE dna and TARGET on same array(SEME QUANTITY OF EACH) but marking the two with different fluorescent color
	-check proportion between tow color for every probe(the proportion is the different number of repetition) 
	-plot: X:position in mB  Y:log(signal intensity)
	-it is not a sure method so after discovering one CV must be check in another way(es. qPCR)	

-NEXT GEN SEQUENCING
	-check the depth and if it has SUDDEN change it may be a copy number variation(higher is depth more sure is the CV detection)
