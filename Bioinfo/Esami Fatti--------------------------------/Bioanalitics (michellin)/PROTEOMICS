PROTEOMICS
-FIGERPRINTING: we look for the spectrum of the various frament generated and confront it to database of peptide fingerprints.
-DE NOVO SEQUENCING: seeing the difference in mass between two sucessive fragment we can calculate the mass(type) of thea added base. 

CHARGE RETAINING NOMENCLATURE(letter + number of residue in the fragment)
-C: x,y,z
-N: a,b,c
