---comparative preotein structure modelling by satisfaction of spacial restrains---

PROTEIN: complex system capable of selforganization in solvent(DeltaG= from 0 to -50 so the folding is spontanuous but not flexible). 
A protein in a protein if the lateral chain are enought to support folding and flexibility.

SPACIAL RESTRAIN: we extract from the protein the spacial limit that have to be respected to have the stability(daidral(phi(CAlpha-C),psi(CAlpha-nitrogen),chi) angle and relative distance among lateral chain  [the atoms in the peptide bond must be on the same plane])
-we simply consider the distance between carbon alpha and consider it as the beckbone with the side chain attached to the joint the apply a COMJUGATE GRADIENT procedure with the target sequence.
-evaluate restrain as probability density function(PDF)
-then we apply CHARMM(transform the restrain in a field of enery) energy to see if our model is stable and get an OBJECTIVE FUNCTION that describe the protein
-"The optimization is carried out by the use of the variable
target function method employing methods of conjugate gradients and molecular dynamics with simulated annealing"
N.B: if the sequence are not the same we have no sure information about lateral chain, IF THE IDENTITY IS LOW IT WONT GIVE DECENT ANSWER.

TEMPLATE:
chose based on functional annotation, identity and coverage

PROTOCOL:
THIORY
-protein family
-template(coveragre >70%, experimental GO annotation, resolution <2A)

PRECTICAL
-blast
-pairwise alignment (PIR Format)
-PDB
-modeller (sript in python) [for project print the terminal tabel at the end of execution]
-chose modell
-JCE superimposition and compute root mean square deviation\ check active site[for project immage of superimposition end relative distance of the active site]
-ramachandra plot for stability

N.B: use the bash script to convert the alignment to the pir(align2pir.sh)
