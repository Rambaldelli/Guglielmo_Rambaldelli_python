PCA (principal component analysis)
-trasformation that put the data in a way to show the highest variances among them.
-we can know what % of variance is shown in each axis after trasformation.
-we can use it to see similarity not immediatly visible.
-we have to chose the number of component we want\need to express as much variance as we want.

N.B.: we can use another test to select only the significant data and than apply PCA only to them.

SCREE PLOT
-show the % of variance shown by each component

VOLCAN PLOT
P-value \ fold changes
	-divide by over\under expressed
