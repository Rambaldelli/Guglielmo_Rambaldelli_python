BACKTACKING (allmost always factorial but some time is polynomial)
-iterative
	es.:
	-knuth-morris-pratt exact string matching
-recursive
	es.: 
	-preorder,inorder,postorder visit
	-depth first search

METHOD(ENUMERATE ALL THE SOLUTION):mhhj
array S of solution
add one decision to S and check if it is a solution
if not return to decision S -1

REDUCE SPACE:
avoid to add tho the tree of S the node and child of them that we are sure are not possible  

PSEUDOCODE---------------------------------------------------- 
Enumeration based on forward recursion

C=possible decision 
subset(S,lenght):
	for i in tot lenght:
		S=S+C
		if i == lenght tot:
			process solution output
		subset(S+1)
