MANHATTAN PLOT:(it is in ralation to a specific trai or sum of trait if designed that way(continuous trait)\ done on a population)[SNP chip]
-Position of SNP in cromosome
-P Value(if it is high tne SNP is associated to our trait)
	-We have a trashold above of wich we have the associeted SNP to our trait
		-usually we assume 5% of significance on one test but we need a correction for multiple test=>
			-Bonferroni correction[inncorrect but more stringent(no independent test!!)] we have to consider the number of 				 aplotipe!
			-FDR(false discovery rate))
	-There will be peacks near the position of the genes that control our trait
-COMPLEX TRAIT(inverted reasoning):
	-we group the individuals based on the genotipe(aa ab bb) of a single SNP and associate the mean of the trait=> if the mean are 	different it means that there is correlation of that SNP to the trait
	N.B: it assume an additive model of ineritance but we can change the model based on what distribution we expect of the mean(additive,dominant, overdominant)
	OR
	-we can use just individuals on the extreme parts of the normal distribution(SELECTIVE GENOTIPING) 
	
N.B:STRATIFICATION
we can have gradient in our population so we need control case for every type of individue in the sample => Principal component analysis to see if it is BIASed

HERITABILITY
how much of the variability of a trait is controlled by genetic factor(usually lower in human than in animal)

SELECTING SWEEP
reduce the variability of gene near a specific mustation because of a strong positive selection on that mutation.
- i can use a WINDOW GWAS to find where the mutation is.

N.B. KEEP IN MIND
