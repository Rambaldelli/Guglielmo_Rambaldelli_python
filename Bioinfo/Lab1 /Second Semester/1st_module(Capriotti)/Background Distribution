 PSI is a function of the sequence lenght
=> we need to find the significance treshold based on the lenght of the alignment.

we want to have a way to have a function that can give usa the parameters of the gumble distribution that descrive the score of random alignment of a fixed lenght.
-> we have a function that give us the parameters of the gumble distribution of the random aligment of that lenght.

P Value: it says us if the best alignment (highest score alignment) is statistically significant.

LEAVE ONE OUT (banchemark strategy):
from a dataset with two sampre for each function i remove one of the two and allign the other against everything else and than i see if the alignment between the original pair score higher than everything else.
