How to answerthe BIOLOGICAL QUESTION:
•To apply the appropriate cellular/human/animal model
•To apply the appropriate experimental design
•To use the appropriate sample size 
•To know the biological/molecular context you are working in 
•To use ad hoc technique
•To recognise the variables 
	(independent/dependent)  
	identify/measure variability

MAIN STRATEGY
•BIOLOGICAL QUESTION/samples
•Ad hoc-technique-PLATFORM
•Data output-pre-processing-data mining 
•SUPERVISED/UNSUPERVISED STATISTICS
•Differential genes/MODELING
•GENE PATHWAYS identification
•Validation

EPIGENETICS: 
	Histones
	chromatin remodelling
	DNA methylation: 
		CYTOSINE MTHILATION:5 position of pyrimidine ring when CpG dinucleotides are present.
	HISTONES: H2A-H2B dimers (2) and H3-H4 tetramer(1), H1(variant)

DNA
-nuclear
-mithocondrial
-microbiome
	-increase variability with age to adapt to aging

GENE EXPRESSION
-microRNA
	-interact with mRNA to modulate(usually inibition)
