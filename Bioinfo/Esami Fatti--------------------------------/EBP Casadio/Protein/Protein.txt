PROTEIN:
<DEFINITION>
-eteropolimer of amminoacids monomer that become amminoacidics residues
-complex system capable of self organization in a polar solvent
-social entity(protein network,pathway)

-it has a structure (4 stucture hierarchy)
-the residue influence the protein folding 
-N=>C verse
-peptide bond cant rotate but the rest can (phi and psi)
-permanent dipole in the peptide plane given the resonance form
-the surface will fold in the best way to have a face to interact with the water trought dipolar interaction.

AMMINOACID(from Carbon Alpha):
-carboxy group protonated at PH 7  
-ammino group
-H
-R chain(the only difference between amminoacid that gives the proprety it id the real residue)

FRUSTRATION(protein are frustrated system):tendency to explore the environment to stabilize itself trought hydrofobic effect
