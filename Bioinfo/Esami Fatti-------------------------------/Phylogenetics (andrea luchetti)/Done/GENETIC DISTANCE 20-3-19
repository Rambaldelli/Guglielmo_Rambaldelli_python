DEFINITION
-transition: a-g c-t
-stransversion: a-c c-g

GAMMA DISTRIBUTION (among site variation)
Lower alpha => more site we have with low substitution frequency

INVARIANT
alternative to gamma category



GENETIC DISTANCE
-observed: percentage of different bases
-expected: markov model
	-each substitution not afected from previous state
	-fixed substitution rate
	-equilibrium between frequencies
	-models:(in order of free parameters(down=more free))
		-JC69
		-K80
		-HKY85
		-TN93
		-GTR

N.B.: PROBLEM
-a single snp could have been changed multiple times (and maybe returned to a prewious state).
-different duration of geneartion
-mitocondrial DNA replicate faster then nucleic DNA
-SATURATION PLOT: signal deacrease with age because of backward mutation untill it reaches a plateau
	-usually 3rd codon position is saturated
	-use 1st and 2nd
