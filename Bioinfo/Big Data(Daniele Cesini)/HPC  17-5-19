HPC: high performance computing



GFLOPS: Billions of Floating Point Operations per second

TDP: Thermal Design Poweris the maximum amount of heat generated by the CPU that the cooling system in a computer is required to dissipate in typicaloperation


Massively Parallel Processor (MPP)-----------------------
	-A single computer with many networked processors
	-Up to thousands of processors

CLUSTER
parallel computer system comprising an integrated collection of independent nodes, each of which is a system in its own right, capable of independent operation and derived from products developed and marketed for other stand-alone purposes


PARALLEL COMPUTING (ifspeedup goes up efficency goes down)
-speedup: increase performance troutght parallel computing
	AMDAHL LAW: max speedup= 1 \ serial fraction
-efficiency: efficency of resources utilization


ACCELERATORS------------------------------------------------------------
Use specifically designed co-processor for specific task (es. GPU)



Shared Memory Systems:-------------------------------------------------
shared memory between programs:
	-avoid redundancy
	-pass data
	-programmed using OpenML
TYPE
	UMA(uniform access)
	NUMA(non uniform access)

Distributed memory systems:------------------------------------------
every processor has his memory
	-need to ask data to other processor (using MPI)
