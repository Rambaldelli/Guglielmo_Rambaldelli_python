N.B.: BAYSIAN PROBABILITY
We take every event as possible but with a statistical chance to be

BEST TREE--------------------------------------------------------------
--DISTANCE MATHOD(algorithmic) [WPGMA, UPGMA, neighbor-joining]
-WPGMA, UPGMA
	-star tree + genetic distances
	
	-unite the closest
	-recalculate distances
	-repeatr
-problem:
	-heterogenicity among branches

-NEIGHBOUR JOINING
Same as prewious but use also NET DIVERGENCE (correction) that will be part of the recalculated distance

-CHARACTER BASED METHOD: more reliable

SHORTCUT
-breanch and bound: add one OTU at a time and evaluate every time the best one
-stepwise addition:

OPTIMALITY CRITERION--------------------------------------------------
-MAX PARSIMONY: less possible mutation needed to reach state
	-good for morfological character
	-cant disrciminate different type of changes

	-PARAMETERS: tree lenght


-MAX LIKELYHOOD: most probable tree
	-toplogy model (es. P(DIM))
	-substitution model(es. GTR+G+I)

N.B.: if same\different breanch lenght tree have similar likelyhood it means we are under molecular clack(consatant mutation rate)

	-PARAMETERS: -ln(likelyhood)


-BAYESIAN INFERENCE 
MCMC
	P(M|D) = P(M) * P(D|M) / P(D)
                       !!!!Look for google drive 27-3-19!!!!

-search best a posteriori probability tree
-cant go to a lower probability tree => faster than max likelyhood
-multiple runs and look for convergences in tree
	-variance should decrease during burning phase
	-N.B: risk of finding local max

MCMCMC (mr bias)
	-'melt' the solution space to avoid local max
