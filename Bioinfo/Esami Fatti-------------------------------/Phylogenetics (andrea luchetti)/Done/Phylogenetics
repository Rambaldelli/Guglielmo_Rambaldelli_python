phylogenetics: few genes
phylogenomics: more that 50 genes


Finding the common ancestor between two OTUS.

mitocondrial DNA: more mutation rate and not recombining(recombining but same allele)

Lenght of Breanch: time distance

OTU: operational taxonomical unit (leaf of the tree)
HTU: hypotetical taxonomical unit (dividing point of brench)
CLADE: group of tips and nodes that derive from a common ancestor

TREES
-rooted (es L.U.C.A.)
-unrooted

ROOT
-mid brench(middle of the longer brench)
-outgrouping(added to have a different OTU and make a root)

CLADE TYPE
-Monophyletic: clade until ONE common ancestor
-Paraphhletic: clade without some of the tips
-Polyphyletic: tips without JUST one common ancestor (es. convergence) (not really a clade)

GENETICS DISTANCE
D=(X->a)+(X->b)

NEUTRAL THEORY
majority of mutation are caused by genetic drift that are neutral and not by natural selection (!! a lot of possible mutation have no effect !!)


POLITOMY(more than 2 brench from a node)
-hard: wrong data (not enough resolution)
-soft: fast radiation: many different forms are produced in short time

REGIONS
-we have to chose the right region to do the analysis because the mutation frequency change along the genome
	regulatory
	structural
	house keeping
	ecc.
-in the codon the third> first > second position in more variable because of synonimous mutation
-codon usage bias (large study)
-selection (ds:synonimous, dn:non-synonimous)
	dn<ds purifying selection
	dn=ds neutral evolution: not under natural selection
	dn>ds positive selection
-there is no relationship mutation\time because of natural selection but there is in neutral evolution
