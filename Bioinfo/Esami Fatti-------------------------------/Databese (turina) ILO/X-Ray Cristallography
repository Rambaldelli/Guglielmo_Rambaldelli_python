CRISTALLOGRAPHY
-Cristalyzing is hard.
-we cant use a X-Ray microscopy because we cant bend xray and so we can not reunite them after the scattering witha lente.
	So we need to use Fourier trasformation to recreate the immage.
-we lose the phase of the x-ray in the experiment but we need it.
	1-we use MULTIPLE ISOMORPHUS REPLACMENT: use heavy metal bound to protein to get the phase (long and hard)
	2-use syncrotrone: MULTIWEAWELENGHT ANOMALOUS DISPERSION
	3-MOLECULAR REPLACMENT when you know homology between target and database
 
FOURIER
-analysis (FT)
	Simulate an electron density based on a model
-synthesis (FT^-1)
	build back the global wave from all it's components

R-FACTOR
Difference between eperimental data and predicted data from the model. => optimization = reduce R-factor(usually minimum 0.15 and problem starts at 0.3)
=>R-FREE(better version of R-Factor)
Same but done on part of the atoms not used by the iteration procedure.
