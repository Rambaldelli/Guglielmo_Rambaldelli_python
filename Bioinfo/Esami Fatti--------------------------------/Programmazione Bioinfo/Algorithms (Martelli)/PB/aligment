Relation between identity and aligned residue: 30% ID with 200 residues => structural identity

SUBSTITUTION MATRIX(210 different substitutio value based on known data and a value of D (gaps)):
-PAM(250): based on global alignment, work for evolutionary similar sequence
-BLOSUM(63): based on local aligment, work for evolutionary different sequence

GAPS: 
-LINEAR: additive cost for all gaps
-AFFINE: first high cost than linear increase

TYPE:
-GLOBAL: NW
-GLOBAL WITHOUT END GAPS: NW with 0 and no end point or penalty
-LOCAL: SW Same but instead of negative value put 0 and restart(so look for the best score 0n all the matrix)
-AFFINE GAPS: Gotoh

EXTREME VALUE DISTRIBUTION:
 exp(-exp([x-Delta]/Beta))
P value= 1 - cumulative

E-VALUE
P-value=1-exp(-E-value)

SIMILARITY SEARCH(not optimal aligment):
HIPOTESIS: if two sequence have identity share similar groups.
-FASTA look for 2-6 lecters word 
-BLAST: dictionary of all 3 lecters word in the sequence(based on extreme value statistics)
