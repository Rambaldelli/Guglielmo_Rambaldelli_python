BURROWS WHELLERS TRANSFORM--------------------------------------------------------
-append $ at the end of the string
-generate all the cyclic shift
-sort them
-take the string made by the last character of the ordered cyclic shift

OPPOSITE
-prepend trasform to transform
-sort
-repeat
-take string ending in $

LF MAPPING
The i-th occurrence of a character x in the last column corresponds to the i-th occurrence of a character x in the first column

PROBLEM:SERCH A QUERY STRING O(n)
-Find the range of “c”s in the first column
-Look at the samerange in the last column
-Let “n” be the next character (i.e. thatpreceding “c” in S)Set B = the LF mapping entry for “n” in the first row of the range  Set E = the LF mapping entry for “n” in the last + 1 row of the range
-Find the range for “n” in the first column, and use B and E to findthe right subrangewithin the “n” range

COMPRESSION---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-take BTW
-move to front
-replace run of 0 with count of 0
-apply huffman
