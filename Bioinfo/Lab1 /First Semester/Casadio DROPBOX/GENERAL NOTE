Beta factor: aproximation occupancy of electron density
Temperature Factor: aprox of electron density scattering


SCORING MATRIX DNA\RNA
piramidin vs purin: cause of different number of hydrogen bonding

DISTRIBUTION:
-binomial 
-bimodal
-gaus
-poisson
-etreme value

APROXIMATION:
Backbone
alpha-alpha distance

TORSION ANGLE(motif of local ordera)
PHI: Calpha-N
PSI: calpha-C
OMEGA:Peptide Bond:not really mobile
CHI: Calpha-C: not really mobile

SCOP:
cluster proteins based on secondary structure

H bond: H is between two strong electronegative center




A PROTEIN IS A PROTEIN:
when has a proportion of secondary structure to cooperate with greavity field and polar solvent

STRUCTURE STUDY:
nmr
X-RAY cristallorgraphy

STRUCTURE 
coil(also turn): 50
alpha: 25
beta: 25

---------------------------MODELLING-------------------------------------

STABILITY CHECK
reconcile the structure with the ramachandra plot(al least 90% allowed)

COVALENT BOND(1.8 ARMSTRONG):
disulphide(week)

STABILIZING INTERACTION:
H bonds (N.B: also water interaction or not)
Wander whals
dipole dipole
charge dipole
charge charge
permanent dipole


MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGMENT
clustal omega
T coffe

ALIGNMENT
method to compare ... manteining the directionality\topology

N.B: lenght of alignment(include gaps) different from lenght of sequence

ALIGNMENT METHODS(no theory only heruristic)
BLAST: local sequence (N.B: optimized for speed) => MAXIMAL SEGMENT PAIRS 
	HPS
		
-sequence vs structure(RMSD <2 armstrong permit us to derivate sequence alignment)
-global(increase all. lenght) vs local(superimposition of some segment):   
-with or without indel(gaps)
-Dinamic programming:
	--scoring matrix (identity=1)  N.B: Log Odd
		blosum 62
		pam 120
		mc lan
	--algorithm
		needleman-wunsh
		add
		add
	--score
		bit= resacaled version of E score on lambda(dimension of sequence) and K(substitution and gap penalty)
		P: probability of the null hypostesis to be true=> chance of finding zero HPS with score higher than S
		E: expected number of random sequence that score higher than our score in the database(correction of P for multiple test) 				based on extreme value distribution
	--statistical validation
		Z score: not reliable for short alignment
