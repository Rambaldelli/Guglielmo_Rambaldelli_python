MOOR'S LAW
genomics dosnt respect it.

POPULATION GENETICS
P: freq of major alleles
Q; freq. Of minor alleles

HARDY-WEINBERG
(p+q)^2=p^2+q^2+2pq
they are the frequencies of the alleles in the population compared to the frequencies of the genotipes, if the populetion respect it it follows the hardy-weinberg equilibrium.

MAF: minor allele frequency
We want the SNP with higest MAF as possible to reduce the probability to have 2 individuals that are the same.
