HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL
asign to our sequence the probability to be generated by the modelngive the family of the protein.

PROBABILISTIC: 
-Generative (can generate sequence with different probability | the probability of the caracteristics of the family)
-Treinable

NULL MODEL: used to calculate the probability of the sequence.



MARKOV MODEL:
Stochastic generator of sequences in which the probability
of state in position i depends ONLY on the state in position
i-1
