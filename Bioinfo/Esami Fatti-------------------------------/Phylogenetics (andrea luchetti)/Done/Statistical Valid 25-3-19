STATISTICAL VALIDATION: NODAL SUPPORT
-RESAMPLING METHODS
	-BOOTSTRAP: resampling with replacment 
		-replace one base each time
		-recalculate with replacment
		-calculate consensus tree -> freq. of node 			presence(treshold 50%)
	-JACKKNIFE: resampling by independent removal

-CHARACTER BASED
	-BREMER: decay index
		-keep adding change
		-see after how many changes the node disapear =>
		decay index
		REVERSE
		-force clade collapse
		-see how many changes needed to achive it

-A POSTERIOR PROBABILITY
