-clusterize genes based on sample
-clusterize sample based on genes

--NORMALIZED (few outliers)--
PEARSON R (correlation coefficent)
-0= perfect correlation
-1= totally uncorrelated

--NOT NORMALIZED (robust to outliers)--
SPEARMAN CORRELATION
Same as pearson but using ranks

EUCLIDIAN DISTANCE

-------------HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING (DENDROGRAM)--------------------
Cluster two genes each time computing the distance, than calculate the distance between the clusterand the next.
-minimum
-maximum
-avarage

N.B.: there are many variant and we must try some of them and statistically validate it.

HEAT MAP
Usually genes X samples:
we cluster the genes based on the different expression levels(compared to reference) in the varous sample(usually controlls and tests)

-----------K-Means-------------------------------------------
	-no hierarchy
	-no deterministic

-Chose two centroid and use it a the 'center' of the cluster
-Assig data to nearest centroid
-Recalculate the centroid every time you add data as a mean of the cluster
