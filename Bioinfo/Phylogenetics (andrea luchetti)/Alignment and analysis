CODING SEQUENCE
-must have number of nuclotide that can be divided by 3 (even if we had a rading frame shift unless is damaged)
-use coding sequences (more conserved)
-be wary that deifferent zone have different selective preassure
-insertion and deletion:
	-entire codon: can affect gene or not
	-some nucleotides: probabliy damaged or changed gene

METHODS:
 PROGRESSIVE ALIGNMENT (clustal)------------------------------
-try to rencostruct the ancestral state in every site
-multiple sequence alignment
	-(match:1, mismatch:-1, gap linear(-2) or affine(-3 , -1))
	-pairwise alignment -> profile (N.B.: sequence order matter)
	-profile alignment
-sequence order
	-pairwise all vs all 
	-create guide tree
	-decide imput order

GUIDE TREE
-clustal
	-can see tree
	-can provide you own tree

ITERATIVE ALIGNMENT (muscle, muffet)----------------------
-raw distance matrix -> tree
-improve alignment
-iterate until plateau
