SYSTEMATICS: catalogation of life.

SPECIATION(cladogenesis): how to population devide until thay became two races.

Panmictic Population: ideal population in wich each one mate with each one.



Darwin: natural selection and hereditability
-mutation or substitution (random)
-selection (non random)

SELECTION
Positive(or purifing)
	-stabilizing
	-directional
Divide one population in two
	-disruptive
Adapt to changing condition
	-balancing
Other
	-sexual

Genetic Drift (opposite of natural selection)
	-bottleneck
	-founder effect
	-natural evolution

=> IF WE HAVE HIGH VARIATION (and population size) NATURAL SELECTION WILL BE STRONGER THAN DRIFT, IF THERE IS LOW VARIATION GENETIC DRIFT WILL BE STRONGER
