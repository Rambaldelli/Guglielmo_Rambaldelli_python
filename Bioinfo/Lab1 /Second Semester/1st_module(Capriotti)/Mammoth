MAMMOTH
-vector between CAlpha (3.5 A)
-move the origin of every vector in the same place 
=> obtain circle radius 1 of all the CAlpha vector (UNIT VECTOR RAPPRESENTATION)
-take group of atom (usually 6) build unit vector and calculate URMS(unit root mean square distance) 
-minimaze URMS
-compare URMS to a random RMSD to see if statistically significant
	10: good (URMS << RMSD)
	0: bad (RMSD = URMS)
-dinamic progremming (linear so fast)
-calculate PSI: percentage of structural identity


N.B.: PSI is a function of the sequence lenght
=> we need to find the significance treshold based on the lenght of the alignment
