DNA: eteropolymer of two complementary chain of desossiribonucleic acid(nucleotides) link by phospodiester bond.
--simply staying in water(polar solvent) the strand of DNA tend to forma duble elix.
--always dinamically changing.
CROMATINE: active DNA plus protein 'working' on it.
STABILIZATION:polar solvent(water) stabilize a lot of biological moleculs
TRASCRIPTION FACTORY:complex that are able to trasript different loci from different chromosomes in the same time.
MOLECULS:eteromoleculs
