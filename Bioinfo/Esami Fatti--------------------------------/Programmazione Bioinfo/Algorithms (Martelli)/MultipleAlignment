PSIBLAST:
used to serch the conserved part in a lot of sequence of diferent thing WITHOUT aligning between them.

-SEQUENCE TO PROFILE ALIGNMENT
Same as normal alignment but the score is calculated with a profile and not a single sequence.



MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT
aligning a lot of sequence all toeghter.
-OPTIMAL: based on NW(same but in more dimension) but too slow for more than 10 seq.
-PROGRESSIVE: (es. clustalW): pairwise all against all than build an identity tree. than use the similar sequence to make profile and align profile with profile for the different brach of the tree and repeat until we arrive to the top
N.B. main problem are the gaps because they can propagate “once a gap, always a gap”

SEQUENCE TO PROFILE AND PROFILE TO PROFILE SCORE
