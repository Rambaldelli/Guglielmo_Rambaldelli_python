# INTRO

To annotate we need a original database that should be analyzed if: 
	-informative 
	-reliable

	N.B.: more important if we are in a high troughtput setting.

We need to extract usefull information from the data: have dependent and independent variables.

=> DATA CURATION
We need manual data curation
	-seq. curation
	-seq. analysis
	-literature curation
	-family based cur.
	-evidence atribution
	-quality check and integration

QUESTIONS
-data good
-analitically or machine learning

---------------------------------------
Only knowing the electron density we can know the theoretical function of the protein
	-phisic
	-computational chemistry



---------------------------------------
## BIOINFO TOOL:

heuristic: no theoretical foundation but experimental tuning



## REFERENCE

the longest isoform is the reference



## GO AND ECO

-GO: classes with relation between them
	-molecular function
	-cell component
	-bio pathway

-ECO code(11): verification type by curator of the GO term.



## TRANSMEMBRANE REGION

standard lenght is 20 AA but it is not a fixed one so it can lead to automatic predctor error. 



## PPI STUDY 

-affinity co purification followed with mass spettroscopy

-two hybrid 



## DATABASES

PFAM(more precise) \ INTERPRO(sum of database) 	:	 family annotation
	-in case of discrepancies use a majority rule or manually check

INTACT \ STRING(different kind of PPI evidences) \ BIOGRID	 :	 PP interaction

SCOP \ CATH(hmm on **prot evolution**)	:	 protein structure

UNIPROT
	HUMSAVAR

​		-human polymorfism and diseses database

​	SIMILAR

​		-list of swissprot prot classified by family



## BUILD A TOOL

download from uniprot secure prot and use them to train the predictor.
