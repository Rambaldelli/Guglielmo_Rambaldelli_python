DNA BARCODING
-folmer region(CO1)mitocondrial:standard region (648bp) is used to identify the species, have standard primers in all species so it easy to sequence.

METABARCODING(use next generation sequencing)
-on enviromental dna: use universal primers and than see wich species are present to see what is present in that area
