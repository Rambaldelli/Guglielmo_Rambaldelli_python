mtDNA(mitocondrial DNA)(16kb)
-probably from procariote

-plants(mitocondrial, cloroplas, nucleous)
-animals(mitocondrial, nucleous)



GENOME ASSEMBLY
-aploid genome better or high inbreeding level

INBREEDING
-possible only if parents have common ancestor
-the level is how close is the common ancestor to the two parents
-it is measured by INBREEDING COEFFICENT(chance of a single gene to be identical by descent) OR in all loci the proportion of autozigosity.
-Population: measured as the mean of th individual of a population.

N.B:case of crossinover we can have a transfer between generation between 0 to 50% => the common descent can have more than 50% inbreed.

 
REFERENCE GENOME
-sequenced reference genome 
-genetic map(old school)

INBREEDIND GENOMIC COEFFICENT
-dont need pedigree info
-no limit to coefficent
-calculated from SNP genotipyng or whole genome genotipyng

ROH(runs of homozigosity)
-continuous portion of chromosome showing homozigosity in all loci

-we use a SNP chip to look for homozigous loci and than sequence to see how long is the ROH
	number of homozigous SNP
	window size
	missed SNP(SNP not showinf eveno if in the SNP chip)
=> the percentage of genome covered by ROH is the INBREEDING GENOMIC COEFFICENT

PARAMETERS(megabase)
-nROH: number of ROH
-lROH:avarage ROH lenght
-sROH: sum of ROH
-FROH(proportion of autosomal genome that is ROH)=sROH\lenght of genome
